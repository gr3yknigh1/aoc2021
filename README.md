# Advent of Code 2021

My first [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).  
This year I will use Python.  

# End  
I gave up on 8th day. I overcomplicated puzzle but at the same time I found algorithm on the paper. So, I will try to solve all other problems by myself in near future ^_^  
It was really fun to do <3
